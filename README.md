Hi, my name is **Aleksejus Kononovicius**. I am working as a senior researcher at [Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy](https://www.ff.vu.lt/tfai/) ([Faculty of Physics](https://www.ff.vu.lt/), [Vilnius University](https://www.vu.lt)). My research interests are stochastic and agent-based modeling, complex systems, Econophysics, Sociophysics, Statistical Physics and Data Science.

I use GitHub primarily to share data and source code related to my research. I also use GitHub to store contents of the [Physics of Risk](https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/) blog.

Currently, I am using programming for scientific purposes as well as to facilitate everyday interactions with my computers (most of which run some
kind of Linux distribution).

For scientific calculations I tend to rely on Python (for quick empirical analysis and model prototyping), numba library or C (for "heavy" calculations) and JavaScript (for interactive web models and complicated calculations requiring object oriented design).  Sometimes, mostly for algebraic manipulations, I rely on Mathematica (Wolfram Engine). Although I try to replace it with sympy library.

In everyday usage I rely on shell (mostly Bash) scripting and Python.

**Actively using:** Python (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, numba, sympy, pymc3), C (GNU Scientific Library), JavaScript (Node.js, jQuery, plotly, d3, Leaflet, TypeScript), Mathematica (Wolfram Engine).

**Markup languages:** LaTeX, Markdown, HTML, CSS.

**Used in the past:** Java, PHP, SQL, Matlab, GNU Octave, Object Pascal.

**Got familiar with:** R, Maple, Mathcad, SPSS, PostScript, SVG.
