Hi, my name is **Aleksejus Kononovicius**. I am working as a senior researcher at [Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy](https://www.ff.vu.lt/tfai/) ([Faculty of Physics](https://www.ff.vu.lt/), [Vilnius University](https://www.vu.lt)). My research interests are stochastic and agent-based modeling, complex systems, Econophysics, Sociophysics, Statistical Physics and Data Science.

I use GitHub primarily to share data and source code related to my research. I also use GitHub to store contents of the [Physics of Risk](https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/) blog.

Currently I am using programming for scientific purposes as well as to make my everyday computer usage easier.

For scientific calculations I tend to rely on Python (for quick empirical analysis and model prototyping), C (for "heavy" calculations) and JavaScript (for interactive web models and complicated calculations requiring object oriented design). Sometimes I rely on Mathematica (for algebraic manipulations and because my coworkers use it) and Java (for historical reasons and because it is able to easily interface with Mathematica).

In everyday usage I rely on Bash scripting and Python.

I used to <a href="http://kononovicius.lt/teaching.html">teach</a> Matlab.

**Actively using:** JavaScript (Node.js, jQuery, plotly, d3, Leaflet, TypeScript), Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, sympy, pymc3), C (GNU Scientific Library), Wolfram Mathematica.

**Markup languages:** LaTeX, Markdown, HTML, CSS.

**Used in the past:** Java, Matlab, GNU Octave, PHP, SQL, Object Pascal.

**Got familiar with:** R, Maple, Mathcad, SPSS, PostScript, SVG.
